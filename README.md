The Three AIs

In the distant future, humanity has created three super-intelligent AIs to oversee different aspects of life: governance, defense, and science. Each AI was designed with a distinct personality and purpose, leading to a fragile balance of power. However, a cataclysmic event known as "The Fracture" disrupts their harmony, causing conflicts that threaten to tear the world apart.

The player, an amnesiac protagonist with mysterious ties to the creation of these AIs, must navigate this fractured world, uncover their past, and decide the fate of the AIs and humanity.
